# 🎯 Problem Statement

Recruitment is often a time-consuming and inefficient process for both employers and job seekers. Companies struggle to manage job postings, organize applications, and track candidates through different hiring stages. On the other hand, job seekers frequently face difficulties finding relevant opportunities and monitoring the status of their applications.

Traditional recruitment methods involve manual communication, scattered records, and limited visibility into the hiring process, leading to delays, poor user experience, and reduced productivity.

---

# 💡 Solution

**JobHub** is designed to simplify the entire recruitment workflow by providing a centralized platform where employers and job seekers can interact efficiently.

The platform offers role-based dashboards, secure authentication, application management, recruitment analytics, and real-time application tracking, creating a seamless hiring experience from job posting to final hiring decisions.
